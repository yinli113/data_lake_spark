# Spark ETL Data Pipeline
This Python script is part of a data pipeline designed to process and transform song and log data using Apache Spark. It performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations to create structured tables and writes the results to Parquet files for further analysis. The pipeline is designed to work with data stored on AWS S3, but it can be adapted for other data sources as well.Â¶

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, you need to have the following prerequisites in place:

- Apache Spark installed and configured.
- AWS credentials set up to access the required S3 buckets.
- Python libraries mentioned in the script, such as pyspark and configparser, installed.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   
    `git clone <repository-url> '
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd spark-etl-data-pipeline
3. Create a dl.cfg file in the project directory with your AWS access and secret keys:
    ```
    [AWS]
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key 
    ```
    
4. Set up your Spark environment by installing Spark and configuring it according to your cluster or local setup.

## Usage
#### To run the ETL pipeline:

1. Open the etl.py script and review the code. Make any necessary adjustments to file paths or configurations to match your environment.
2. Run the script using the following command:
  ` spark-submit etl.py `
3. The script will process the song and log data, perform the ETL operations, and write the results to Parquet files in the specified output directory.

## File Structure
#### The project directory contains the following files:

- **etl.py**: The main Python script for the ETL data pipeline.
- **dl.cfg**: Configuration file for AWS access keys.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.

## Contributing and Further Development

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving this ETL data pipeline or want to contribute to its development, we encourage you to get involved. Here are some areas where you can make a difference:

### Analytic Data Stores
- **Enhance Data Processing**: Explore additional data processing steps to create more advanced analytic data stores. Consider looking for data skewness, malformed data, or applying MapReduce techniques to optimize data processing and analytics.

### Data Quality and Reliability
- **Data Validation**: Implement data validation checks to ensure the quality and reliability of the processed data. Detect and handle malformed or inconsistent data gracefully.

### Performance Optimization
- **Optimize Spark Jobs**: Fine-tune Spark jobs to improve performance and efficiency. Consider optimizing data partitioning, caching, and resource allocation.

### Documentation and Testing
- **Documentation**: Improve project documentation, including code comments, README updates, and data schema explanations.
- **Testing**: Expand test coverage and write unit tests to ensure the robustness of the ETL pipeline.

Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have ideas, suggestions, or contributions. We value your input and collaboration in making this data pipeline even better.
